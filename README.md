# omz-themes-standalone

A standalone plugin that gives you the [oh-my-zsh][ohmyzsh] themes without requiring everything else that comes with oh-my-zsh.

**Note:** this plugin makes it easier to use parts of omz without requiring the full thing.

## Usage

Simply set a theme in your `.zshrc` file and source this plugin:

```zsh
# CHANGE ME
ZSH_PLUGINS=~/path/to/my/plugins

# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="refined"
source $ZSH_PLUGINS/omz-themes-standalone/omz-themes-standalone.zsh
```
